# Fashion Store — Brittania

**>>> Website under construction <<<**

## About this project

The goal of this project was to make an app that used a firebase backend: Making use of its API, doing fetches from the network and hosting a more "real-life" application.

I use `react-router` and `i18next` as well. I may add more technologies as I go — I just learned about continuous integration and it seemed cool. I also got in touch with styled-components. We'll see!

I will abide by the workflow of:

- Setting tasks on ClickUp (Kanban app)
- Creating a branch per task
- Write tests before writing code
- Do atomic commits while coding
- Use rebase for merging to main (I have no clue how this will go — aren't adventures fun?)
