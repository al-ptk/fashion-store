# Fashion Store — Brittania

## About this project

The goal of this project was to make an app that used a firebase backend: Making use of its API, doing fetches from the network and hosting a more "real-life" application.

I use `react-router` and `i18next` as well. I may add more technologies as I go — I just learned about continuous integration and it seemed cool. I also got in touch with styled-components. We'll see!
